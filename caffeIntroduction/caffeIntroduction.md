One the projects I am currently working on is about machine learning, more precisely about neural network.
The aim is to train a neural network to detect faces on an image. To do so, we used caffe, a well-known framework for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
In short, a CNN is a neural network processing on images. The main problem with caffe is its documentation, so I'd like to explain how
to use it, as simply as I can.

##Install caffe
The installation of caffe can be quite difficult. Some people use a Virtual Machine, I prefer using docker: it is lighter, and I had some problems with VM and caffe.
Of course, you need docker installed [https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

First, you need to download caffe.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BVLC/caffe.git
```

    "My last publication was on Subgroup Discovery for Sequences (you can access it freely [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336315710_SeqScout_Using_a_Bandit_Model_to_Discover_Interesting_Subgroups_in_Labeled_Sequences)). However, in Data Science community, a lot of people are not aware of what \"Subgroup Discovery\" or \"Pattern Mining\" is. So let's see on a quick pratical example how to use it : knowing if Mushrooms are poisonous.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Subgroup Discovery ?\n",
    "Subgroup Discovery, Emerging Patterns, Contrast Set, or Discriminative Pattern Mining all refers to the same idea: finding patterns that are discriminative of a target class. In other words, the aim is to find predictive **interpretable** rules of a class. \n",
    "As an example, Herrera et al used Subgroup Discovery in the context of a [pyschiatric emergency department](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Luis_Jimenez-Trevino/publication/220176495_Evolutionary_fuzzy_rule_extraction_for_subgroup_discovery_in_a_psychiatric_emergency_department/links/0f317530f622867ad7000000/Evolutionary-fuzzy-rule-extraction-for-subgroup-discovery-in-a-psychiatric-emergency-department.pdf). They found rules like:\n",
    "- If Sex=Male and DAY=Monday -> Suicide\n",
    "- If Sex=Female and (DAY=SUNDAY or DAY=MONDAY) and TIME=LATE_EVENING -> Suicide  \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course those rules are not correct 100% of the time, but they tell you that **when the pattern appears, there are more chances that the class appears too**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is interesting for two reasons:\n",
    "- **Understanding your data** in a way that is interpretable by an expert.\n",
    "- Using those patterns to **improve classification** or regression algorithms. Indeed, as they are discriminative of a target class, you can use them as features to improve classical supervised learning.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Subgroup discovery can then be used to improve your system, *thanks to interpretability*: having the knowledge that people have more suicidal thoughts on sunday and monday, particulary on the night, you can put more workers on those period of time in department, for example. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Let's try it on Mushroom\n",
    "[Mushroom](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/mushroom) is a famous dataset which contains characteristics of different species of mushrooms: its odor, its color, its habitat etc. More importantly, there is also the information that the mushroom is edible, or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be our target class: when using a subgroup discovery algorithm, we give a dataset and a target class, and the algorithm returns a set of rules discriminative of the class. Here we are looking for *patterns* discriminative of Poisonous mushrooms. In other words, we want to find the **conjunction of features that are characteristics of poisonous mushrooms**.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's install [pysubgroup](https://github.com/flemmerich/pysubgroup), wich is an implementation of several subgroup discovery algorithms, in python:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pysubgroup\n",
    "```"

In this formalism you can also use exhaustive algorithm to list all possible rules, which is not the case in a decision tree, greedy by nature."

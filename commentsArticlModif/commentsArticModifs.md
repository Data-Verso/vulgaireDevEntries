# Comments and article submission/modification

## Comments

Some time ago, I developed a login/commentary system for this blog. There was a little work to do (this blog
is developed with django) but it worked, so it was fine for me. With time, I decided that it was too much
work for an user to post a comment : you need to register, give your email adress, then post your comment,
it is too much to do for just a simple comment. That's why I decided to use an external service : disqus.

Disqus is a commentary system, widely used on the web. Its utilisation is quite simple: you create an account,
 add some javascript to your website, and there you go. It's quite good looking, and one of the main advantage 
is that it let you login with your disqus, or facebook, or twitter or google plus (humpf...) account to post 
a comment. You don't have to register anymore !

So if you have a question, or information, or want to express yourself, feel free to do it in the comment
section !
